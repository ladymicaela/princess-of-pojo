## Background

The 1989 Prince of Persia is a cult classic platformer computer game. In the game, the main character has 60 minutes to escape a dungeon, get to the palace tower, defeat Jaffar, and rescue the Princess. Not only does he face guards, but also has to avoid various traps like breakaway tiles and spike pits.

In Princess of Pojo, I attempted to recreate this classic platformer, but with a slight gender twist.
